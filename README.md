## Instructions to run the code
All codes for taxi, cartpole and mountain car problem are in a single notebook. Run one by one to ouput the solutions. First requirement is to have Anaconda installed and run jupyter notebook from there. pip install gym in anaconda prompt. Also, pip install individual modules. If you are having any problem like- "module gym is not found" when trying to import gym, then you have to do sys.path.append("path where anaconda site packages are saved"). 
https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/issues/56 addresses the module not found problem.
